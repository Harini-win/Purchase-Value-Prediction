# Purchase-Value-Prediction
Developed a full ML pipeline to predict purchase value from user session data using advanced preprocessing, feature engineering, and model ensembling.
- Performed detailed EDA, missing value imputation, target & label encoding, and feature scaling.
- Trained and compared models: Ridge, Lasso, MLPRegressor, GradientBoosting, VotingRegressor, Adaboost, XGBoost, Random Forest.
- Applied GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning and selected best model via test R² and error metrics.
- Achieved a test R² score of 0.96 with GradientBoostingRegressor.
- Conducted overfitting/underfitting analysis and selected features for optimal generalization.
